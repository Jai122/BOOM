7:00 PM</center></h3>
         <h3><center>North Bergen, NJ</center></h3>
         <p>"An out of state corporation is proposing a massive power plant for North Bergen, NJ to send electricity to NYC. The power plant would more than double the air pollution already caused by the PSEG Bergen Generating Plant, producing particulate matter and ground level ozone, both of which cause chronic heart and lung disease. The plant would also threaten the environment of the Wetlands region, and would be one of the largest sources of green house gas emissions in NJ for decades to come. Learn how you can protect your health, safety, environment and property values at the public information meeting on Wednesday, August 29th at 7pm. The meeting will be held in the Iglesia De Dios En Cristo La Senda, 300

         <h3><center>August 31, 2018 @ 10:30 AM</center></h3>
         <h3><center>New York, New York</center></h3>
         <p>"NYC has had 7 years of increasing overdose deaths with 1,441 lives lost in 2017—that’s a life lost every six hours. More people are dying from an overdose than homicides, suicides, and traffic accidents combined. The impact is heightened for people who are marginalized: overdose is the leading cause of death among people living in NYC shelters; people leaving incarceration are 40 times more likely to overdose in the first two weeks of release; and, last year, the black community had an 80% increase (the largest among all demographics) of fatal overdoses. 

International Overdose Awareness Day is an important day to bring awareness to the overdose crisis, but as a community WE DEMAND ACTION."</p>

         <p>"Activists across the country know that 2018 is one election year we can't afford to sit out, with our most fundamental values of justice, equality, and dignity on the line.

That's why we're gathering together in solidarity on September 8th for Thousands of Doors for Justice (TDJ).

TDJ is a day of action for activists and volunteers across the state to step up and fight for issues of economic, racial, social, women's, environmental, and immigrant justice. 

Advocates will take action in many forms, including knocking on doors, making calls, registering voters, training volunteers, recruiting new activists, and more. As a broad spectrum of volunteers and organizations, we will each contribute in the best ways we can and embrace our collective struggle.

      <p>According to her testimony, Noura refused to consummate the marriage, resisting him for the first four days. On the fifth, she says her husband raped her, with the help of a number of his male relatives (cousins and some people said the husband's brothers aswell), pinned her down while he was raping her right before their eyes.The following day, when her husband attempted to rape her again, she stabbed him in self defence and it killed him. When she told her family, her father delivered her to the police, and then disowned her.

That was in 2017. On Sunday, April 29, 2018, Noura was found guilty in court of premeditated murder, the punishment for which is death by hanging. <i>-Zaynub AFINNIH</i></p>

      <p>This is unacceptable. Threats of rape are used intentionally to terrorize women into submission and silence. Twitter bullies use rape threats because they know it instills a level of fear in women that can only rival the threat of murder. We cannot as a global society accept this kind of behavior. Twitter has block and mute features, but they’re not enough. They don't stop the threats, and they do nothing to stop Twitter from being a platform that fosters violence against women. We know that there are hundreds of thousands of users who have made these threats. I'm all for free speech, but threatening rape and the brutal violation of another's body is NOT something we should protect. <i>-Brenda Tracy</i></p>

      <p>Right now, a British company named Oxitec is planning to release genetically modified mosquitoes into the fragile enviroment of the Florida Keys and Texas. The company wants to use the Florida Keys and Texas  as a testing ground for these mutant bugs. Even though the local community in the Florida Keys has spoken -- we even passed an ordinance demanding more testing -- First ,  Oxitec is trying to use a loophole by applying to the FDA for an "animal bug" patent. Now, the hot potato has passed to the EPA and  Oxitec is at it again. This profit driven biotech company wants to release more than 50 million GMO mosquitoes per week into Florida and Texas. These GMO mosquitoes could pose major risks to fragile ecosystems like the Florida Keys  and Texas and may pose risks to public health and safety. <i>-Mila de Mier</i></p>

        <p>We are facing the most serious threat to abortion rights in 45 years.

   With the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Trump has fulfilled his campaign promise to nominate a highly conservative judge who could overturn Roe v. Wade by nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh. His nomination could give states the right to outlaw abortion -- ending the right to safe and legal abortion for women across the country. As a mother of two, I had the right and privilege to choose the size and timing of my family; it terrifies me that my sons, nieces, and nephews may not have the same.

   But there's still a chance to protect reproductive rights. My senator, Republican Senator Susan Collins, could have the deciding vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination for the court -- will you join me in asking her to reject his nomination? <i>-Abby King</i></p>

        <p>In December of 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 to repeal net neutrality rules -- giving big cable companies room to charge extra fees, block and censor users. By removing ISPs from Title II of the Communications Act, a rule that means ISPs are subjected to tougher regulations that prevent them blocking sites, creating paid "fast" lanes, and throttling internet speeds. This decision will have global implications for the way the world shares and receives information from journalists, newsrooms, and NGOs. <i>-Change.org</i></p>

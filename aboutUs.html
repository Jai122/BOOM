    <h1>WHAT IS BOOM?</h1>
    <p>BOOM is a website created by four intellectually curious girls. As a final project for their 7 week Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code, the girls decided to create a website that promotes social awareness. The girls believe the website will help communities within the Tri-state Area become stronger. The website advertises social justice, volunteerism, and more.</p>
     <p>The four girls met during the 2018 Summer Immersion Program. The four wanted to create something that would better the community, consequently, BOOM was created.
